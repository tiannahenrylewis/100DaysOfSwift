## Project 2: Guess The Flag :white_check_mark:

After every answer the user receives a UIAlert letting them know whether they got the question right or wrong, and corrects them if answered incorrectly. This goes on for a series of 10 questions where they are then presented their final score and can opt to try again for another series of 10 questions.
